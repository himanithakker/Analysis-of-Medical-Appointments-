BRIEF -


We accessed the data from "nycopendata.com" using Open Data API (OData API) and performed Data Connection with Tableau.
Then, we cleaned the data using Python and stored it in Google Cloud Storage as a Bucket to create a virtual instance.
We performed our analysis using Google's Big Query in Google Cloud Platform and stored the query results in CSV files.
